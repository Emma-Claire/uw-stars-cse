## Midterm

### Programming Problems
####Concepts
_You should plan to be fully prepared for everything listed below_

* Using `Random` objects
* Using `Scanner` objects
* Solving fencepost problems
* Solving cumulative sum problems
* Solving counting problems
* Finding the max and min in a set of values
* Being able to look at the individual digits of a number using integer arithmetic
* Being able to look trhough the individual characters in a String

#### Tips
* Write the method header first, with the correct return value, name, and parameters along with open curly brace and closing curly brace (this will usually earn you a minimum of 1pt)
* Complete problems 1 – 7, write the method header for 8 (the hard programming problem), then go back and check your solutions for 1 – 7, and finally work on the solution for 8.
* Do not open your test before told to begin, and stop writing when time is called; don't lose these points .. its never worth it.
