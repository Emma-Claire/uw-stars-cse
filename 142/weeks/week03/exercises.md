## Week 3

1. Write nested for loops that produce the following output.

  ```java
  000111222333444555666777888999
  000111222333444555666777888999
  000111222333444555666777888999
  ```

2. Write a method called __printNumbers__ that accepts a maximum number as a parameter and prints each number from 1 up to that maximum, inclusive, boxed by square brackets. For example, consider the following calls. You may assume that the value passed to printNumbers is 1 or greater.

  ```java
  printNumbers(15);
  printNumbers(5);
  ```
  These calls should produce the following output
  ```java
  [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15]
  [1] [2] [3] [4] [5]
  ```

3. Write a method called __largerAbsVal__ that takes two integers as parameters and returns the larger of the two absolute values. A call of largerAbsVal(11, 2) would return 11, and a call of largerAbsVal(4, -5) would return 5.

4. Write a method __largestAbsVal__ that accepts three integers as parameters and returns the largest of their three absolute values. For example, a call of largestAbsVal(7, -2, -11) would return 11, and a call of largestAbsVal(-4, 5, 2) would return 5.
