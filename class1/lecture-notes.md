# Lecture Notes
### General
* Every piece of code you write needs to be inside of a class
* Class is executable only if it has a __main__ method
* Commands end with semicolons
* Escape sequences
* Your goal for all assignments is to reduce redundancy
* You want main to be short, and give an good overview of what your program does
* Java precedence
* Integer division
* Must declare a variable before you use it, but can't declare it twice
* Understanding assignment statements
* Three main data types (you will learn more later)

 | Date type   | Description 
 | :-----------|-------------------------------------------------------------- |
 | int         | integers, pos, zero, neg, up to 2^31-1                        |
 | double      | floating point numbers (real), pos, zero, neg, up to 10^308   |
 | String      | text characters                                               |
* Literals
 * int literal: number without a decimal, e.g., -7, 0, 103
 * double literal: number with a decimal, e.g., -7.0, 0.2, 103.5
 * String literal: characters surrounded by quotes, e.g., "hello world"


### Style
  * Classes start with a capital letter, no spaces, all other words in name are also capitalized
  * Methods start with lowercase letters, no spaces, all other words in name are capitalized
  * Indentation is importnat, when you open a curly brace everything inside is indented
