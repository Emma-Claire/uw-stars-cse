### Variables
* In Java we need to declare variables with a type and a name before they can be used
* Once a variable is declared you cannot redeclare it (with a type)

### Assignment statements
* `=` is the assignment operator, it has nothing to do with equality
* Assignment statements should be read right-to-left
```
  // 1 is stored in the int variable named x
  int x = 1;
  // 1 is added to the current value of x (in this case 1), resulting in 2, and that is stored back into x
  x = x + 1;  
```
