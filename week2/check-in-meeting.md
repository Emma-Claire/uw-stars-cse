# Check-in Meeting
## Week 2

### Expressions
  1. `(238 % 10 + 3) % 7`	
  2. `(18 - 7) * (43 % 10)`	
  3. `2 + 19 % 5 - (11 * (5 / 2))`	
  4. `813 % 100 / 3 + 2.4`	

### Mystery variables
1. What are the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` after the following code is executed?
  ```
  int a = 2;
  int b = 4;
  int c = 3;
  int d = a + b;
  a = c - b - a;
  b = c;
  c = a + d - b;
  ```

2. What are the values of `e`, `f`, and `g` after the following code is executed?
  ```
  int e = 1;
  int f = 0;
  int g = -1;
  int h = e + f + g;
  e = f - h;
  f = e;
  g = f * g - e;
  ```

### Programming
1. Write a for loop that produces the following output:

  `1 4 9 16 25 36 49 64 81 100`

2. Write a piece of code that uses a for loop to compute and print the first 12 Fibonacci numbers:

  `1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144`
