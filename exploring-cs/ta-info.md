# TA information

* When do you want to have your office hours, 2 hours a week
* Be active on Slack, answering student questions
* When helping students, do not drive (touch the keyboard, or mouse), or offer direct solutions, instead try your best to guide them to the answer
	* Often directing them to the reference or telling them the line the bug is on will help
* You will each grade 10 homeworks a week, use the rubric put provide lots of written comments as well. I expect you to be spending 1 â€“ 2 hours grading, if you are getting it done in 10 minutes, then you aren't adding enough thoughtful comments
* I will send you the assignments to grade each week
* Fridays are help sessions to get feedback form you
