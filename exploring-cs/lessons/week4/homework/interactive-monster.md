# Week 4 Homework

## Interactive Monster
_[Due Friday, 04/28, at 9pm](https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1158649/assignments/3672952)_

### Goals
This assignment will help you practice using if-statements, to allow your program to make decisions and perform different operations. You will be creating a custom monster, with at least one moving eye, and jumping interactions. 

### Specification
* Your canvas size should be around 800x800, but adjust as it makes sense for your project
* Your monster should be created with a series of methods using parameters
* Your monster must be able to switch between jumping and eye movements when the user clicks the mouse
* [Video walk-through](https://vimeo.com/213890295) of what we are expecting

### Tasks
1. Create your own customized monster, it should have it's very own method with parameters to control its position. It should have at least 1 leg and at least 1 eye, but everything else is up to you. Some inspiration is shown below, but remember this monster should be your very own and not a copy of someone else's. As usual please sketch your ideas before you start to code and save those sketches as you will be submitting them.

	Feel free to also explore the [monster code](../code/monster.pde) we reviewed in class to review methods, parameters, style, and commenting.

	Make sure to run your code, and ensure your monster looks as intended before moving on to the next step.

1. Setup the if statements to control whether your program will display a monster with moving eyes, or a jumping monster. First start by creating an `int` variable named `page` at the top of your code, you should set its starting value to 0. Then add the code below to draw.

	```java
	// call your monster method
	if (page == 0) {
		// add code here as you complete step 4
	} else {
		// add code here as you complete step 5
	}
	```

	Notice, that your `draw` method should have only 1 call to your monster method.

1. Add a `mousePressed` method that will switch between your two pages. If your monster is jumping and the user clicks then it should switch to the moving eye monster, if they click again it should switch back to the jumping monster .. and so on.

	To do this you will add `page = 1 - page;` into your `mousePressed` method.

	Run your code, you won't see any changes yet because you haven't written code to tell your monster to jump or move its eye but you should still see your monster and have no errors before moving on to the next step.

1. Write code to move your eye(s). First add a float variable at the top of your code named `eyeShift` and set its value to `0.0`. 

	Then find where your eye method is called from and add `eyeShift` to your x value being passed into that eye method.

	Before proceeding, temporarily initialize `eyeShift` to `10.0` and to `-10.0`, and notice that the eye should look right and then left; then set it back to `0.0`. If its not moving then you have a bug, try and fix it and if you are stuck reach out for help.

	Add code to draw as indicated in step 2. This code should consist of conditional statements to determine if the eye should move left or right based on the mouse's x-position (hint: you will use the Processing built in variable named `mouseX`). Notice that you will probably want to increment your eyeShift variable by 0.5 instead of 1 so it moves slowly.

	You may also consider using min/max to prevent your monster's eye from leaving its face.

	Test your code. The eye should move when the mouse is on each side. You can decide whether the eyes should still move when the mouse is between them.

	If its working correctly, when you click it should stop your eye(s) from moving, if you click again it should let you move the eyes again.

1. Write code so that your monster jumps up and down. To start define two variables at the top: `jump`, and `jumpDirection`, you decide on the values for your monster.

	In draw (inside of the else), add an if statement to determine which way the monster should be jumping. When it hits the top it should come back down, and when it hits the bottom it should come back up. `jump` is the value you are adding to the `y` position of your monster and `jumpDirection` represents the speed and direction your monster is moving.

	If its working you should now be able to click to switch between your moving eyes and jumping monster.

### Grading Rubric

| Description | Points |
| :--- | :--- |
| Your monster is defined as a series of methods, and those methods are called correctly | 2 pts |
| Parameters are used correctly throughout the entire program | 2 pts |
| All variables mentioned in the assignment are created and used correctly, including: page, eyeShift, jumpValue, and jumpDir | 1 pts |
| With a mouse click the monster switches between jumping and eye movements | 1 pts |
| Eye movements work correclty | 2 pts |
| Jumping works correctly | 2 pts
| Conditional statements are used correctly | 1 pts |
| Code is commented as described in the assignment with a top comment block, line comments in setup and draw, and top method comments | 2 pts |
| Code is indented correctly | 2 pts |
| Digital or paper sketch included to show process and planning | 1 pts |
| Extra credit: Goes above and beyond and implemented some of the extra challenges or went above and beyond to create an exceptional piece | 2pts |

### [Submission](https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1158649/assignments/3672952)
* Your code should have a top comment block with your name, last edited date, and a brief description of the entire program
* Each line in setup and draw should have a comment
* Each method that you created should have a top comment briefly explaining what that method does (note that setup and draw do not need top comments)
* Upload your pde file and your planning sketch to [canvas](https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1158649/assignments/3672952)

### Extra Challenge
* Add code to make it look like the monster is bending its knees as it jumps (hint: you can achieve this effect my varying the length of the monster's leg(s))
* Add a button that allows the user to switch by clicking on a button instead of just any mouse click
* Add some more interactive elements by adding more buttons and more monster versions
* Add more custom details to your monster
* Add an interesting moving background
