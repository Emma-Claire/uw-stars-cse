# Week 1 Homework

## Digitize an analog piece of art
_[Due Friday, April 7th, 9:00pm](https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1158649/assignments/3672949)_

### Goal 
In this programming assignment you will practice all the skills you learned in the first day of class, by recreating an analog piece of art in a digital format using Processing.

### Part 1: Choose a piece of art
Locate a piece of art that inspires you, for this project it is best if you choose an artwork with geometric-like shapes. A few resources are linked below, but feel free to look elsewhere

* [Harvard Art Museums Collections](http://www.harvardartmuseums.org/collections?)
* [Museum of Modern Art Collections](http://www.moma.org/collection/)
* [Artstror](http://offcampus.lib.washington.edu/login?url=http://www.artstor.org/index.shtml) Note: You will need to login with your UW netid for full access
* [Oxford Art Online](http://offcampus.lib.washington.edu/login?url=http://www.oxfordartonline.com/) Note: You will need to login with your UW netid for full access

Download the image, and decide either to reproduce the entire artwork or select a crop of the artwork (this is best for artworks with lots of details). If you need help cropping your image, reach out to your instructional team. You will need to turn in either the entire image or the crop depending on what you decide.

### Part 2: Make a Plan
Plan out what shapes you will use in Processing to represent the shapes in the artwork, draw it out by hand so you have a guide to work from. 

You will also want to plan out the colors you are going to use. You will more than likely want to use Photoshop, Gimp, or another piece of software to pull the RGB color values from the artwork. If you need help with this please reach out to your instructional staff.

You do not need to directly replicate the artwork, instead use it as inspiration to create a digital version.

### Part 3: Write the code
Write your static code (no draw function needed) in Processing making sure to include comments as you go that explain your code. We highly recommend that you run your code often so you can discover errors along the way instead of waiting until the very end.

In most situations we expect you to use many different kinds of Processing functions including but not limited to `line`, `triangle`, `quad`, `rect`, `ellipse`, `arc`, `stroke`, `fill`, and `background`. 

### Grading Rubric

| Description | Points |
| :--- | :--- |
| Student created a unique and creative digitization of a piece of art work | 4 pts |
| Student uses a variety of p5.js functions correctly as necessary | 3 pts |
| Program includes comments on almost every line | 2 pts |
| Program is indented correctly | 1 pt |
| Student included their planning sketch with their submission | 1 pt |
| Student included original art image in their submission | 1 pt |

### [Submission](https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1158649/assignments/3672949)
Make sure your code has a comment on most every line and then upload your .pde file to [canvas](https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1158649/assignments/3672949), along with your planning sketch and the image file of the original artwork. If you need any help saving and uploading your files please reach out to your instructional staff.
